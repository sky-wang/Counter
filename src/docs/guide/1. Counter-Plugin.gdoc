h1. Introduction

This plugin manage counters, e.g. you can create a simple access statistic for a website or it can be used as back-end for polling or voting. 
Every counter has a name and every increment is logged with date and time.

And with the simple tag: @<g:counterMonthlyGraph countMonth="6" name="Test" />@ you have a statistics report as line graph.

h1. Installation

From official repository: 

{code}
grails install-plugin counter
{code}

Or from file:

{code}
grails install-plugin [path_to]/counter.zip
{code}

Start your application and navigate to the page @[path_your_app]/counter@. You will see simple test page.

h1. Usage

h2. Increment a counter

Increment a counter within a controller action:

{code}
def counterService

// Within an action you can increment a counter
counterService.increment(name: "Test")
{code}

Increment a counter within a web page (initiated from client side). 

Insert in the body of the HEAD-Section of your GSP: 
{code:xml}
<script src="${createLink(action: 'increment', controller: 'counter', params: [name: 'Test'])}" type="text/javascript"></script>
{code}

Or increment a counter with AJAX. The following example needs JQuery.
{code}
$.get(${createLink(action: 'increment', controller: 'counter')}, {name: 'Test'})
{code}

h2. Show the monthly graph

First you have to include some needed Javascript files in the body of the HEAD-Section of your GSP. The Counter-Plugin provides a simple tag for that.

{code}
<g:counterRes />
{code}

{note}This tag will include some needed Javascript files especially JQuery. If you have already the JQuery use the attribute @omitJQuery='true'@ to omit it.{note}

And now you can integrate the monthly graph in the BODY-Section of your GSP:
{code}
<g:counterMonthlyGraph countMonth="6" name="Test"
{code}
